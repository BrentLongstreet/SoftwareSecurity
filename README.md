# SoftwareSecurity

Artemis Financial is a financial firm that wants to create a way for their customers to use financial services in a secure manner. They want to allow the user to select different plan options. Personally, I exceled at performing dependency checks as these were what I enjoyed the most. It highlighted potential software exploits and I was able to discover the most vital and suppress the unimportant ones. Security allows the customer to trust the buisness more and are willing to utilize the product. This provides the financial firm with credibility. The most difficult part of the dependency checks was being able to accurately identify the false posivitives. I create SSL certificates for the web hosted project to ensure the information was being encrypted to incresae the layers of security. In the future, I want to be able to more accurately identify the false positives in a dependency check. In order to ensure the code and software application were functional and secure, I ran dependency checks and implemented encrption algorithms. After refactoring the code, I had to recheck the dependency alerts and address them. I utilized visual studio code to test the encrption algorithms before implementing them into the web based project. To showcase my skills to future employers, I will show them my vulnerability assessment report which analyzes the security checks and implementations performed on the Artemis Financial Insitution.
